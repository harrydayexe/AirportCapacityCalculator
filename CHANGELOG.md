## [Unreleased]

### Major: Event-Driven Simulation Engine Redesign

Complete architectural redesign from formula-based aggregate calculations to event-driven state-window simulation.

#### Added

**Event System** (`internal/simulation/event/`)
- `Event` interface for time-based state changes
- `EventQueue` priority queue for chronological event processing
- `CurfewStartEvent` and `CurfewEndEvent` for operation restrictions

- Automatic simulation time boundaries (one year)
- Event generation from all policies before processing
- Comprehensive logging for event processing

**Testing Infrastructure**
- `test_helpers.go` with `mockEventWorld` and `testLogger()`
- Event counting and verification helpers
- Comprehensive test suite for all policies using event-driven approach

#### Changed

**Breaking Changes**

**Airport Model** (`internal/airport/airport.go`)
- **BREAKING**: Removed `MinimumSeparation` field from `Airport` struct
- **Rationale**: Enables per-runway separation configuration
- **Migration**: Move separation to individual `Runway` structs

**Runway Model** (`internal/airport/runway.go`)
- `MinimumSeparation` field already existed per-runway
- Now the only source of separation configuration

**Policy Interfaces**
- **BREAKING**: Removed `Apply(ctx, state, logger)` method from all policies
- **BREAKING**: Removed support for direct state modification
- **Migration**: Policies must implement `GenerateEvents(ctx, world)` instead

**CurfewPolicy** (`internal/simulation/policy/curfew.go`)
- Complete rewrite to generate daily curfew events
- `GenerateEvents()` creates paired start/end events for each day
- Overnight curfew support (e.g., 11 PM to 6 AM next day)
- Events generated for entire simulation period (365+ days)
- Removed legacy `Apply()` method
- Removed unused imports (`fmt`, `log/slog`)

**MaintenancePolicy** (`internal/simulation/policy/maintenance.go`)
- Complete rewrite to generate per-runway maintenance events
- `GenerateEvents()` schedules maintenance windows based on frequency
- Maintenance windows distributed evenly across simulation period
- Per-runway validation against world's runway list
- Supports multiple runways with independent schedules
- Removed legacy `Apply()` method
- Removed unused imports

**RunwayRotationPolicy** (`internal/simulation/policy/rotation.go`)
- Complete rewrite to generate single rotation efficiency event
- `GenerateEvents()` schedules one `RotationChange` event at simulation start
- Efficiency multiplier set for entire simulation duration
- Custom configuration support maintained
- Removed legacy `Apply()` method
- Removed unused imports (`log/slog`)

**Simulation Engine** (`internal/simulation/engine.go`)
- Removed legacy `Calculate()` method that used `SimulationState`
- Removed `calculateOperatingSeconds()` (no longer needed)
- Removed old `calculateRunwayCapacity()` with aggregate calculation
- New `Calculate()` method signature: `Calculate(ctx, *World)` instead of `Calculate(ctx, *SimulationState)`
- Engine now processes events instead of modified state

**Simulation Orchestration** (`internal/simulation/simulation.go`)
- Removed `SimulationState` struct entirely
- Removed `runLegacy()` and `runWithEvents()` methods
- Removed backward compatibility routing logic
- Single `Run()` method using only event-driven approach
- Removed state helper methods: `GetOperatingHours()`, `SetOperatingHours()`, etc.

**Test Suite**
- Complete rewrite of all policy tests
- `curfew_test.go`: Event generation validation, overnight curfews, full year simulation
- `maintenance_test.go`: Multiple runways, frequency/duration verification, invalid runway handling
- `rotation_test.go`: Efficiency multiplier verification, custom configuration tests
- All tests migrated from state-checking to event-counting approach

#### Removed

**Legacy Components**
- `SimulationState` struct and all references
- Legacy `Policy.Apply()` interface method
- Backward compatibility code for old policy system
- `Engine.calculateOperatingSeconds()` method
- Old `Engine.calculateRunwayCapacity()` aggregate formula method
- `mockSimulationState` test helper (replaced with `mockEventWorld`)
- Global `Airport.MinimumSeparation` field

**Unused Code**
- Unused imports in policy files after migration
- Legacy test cases using `Apply()` method
- State modification helpers in `simulation.go`

#### Fixed

**Curfew Event Generation**
- Fixed boundary condition for events at simulation end time
- Changed from `.Before(endTime)` to `!.After(endTime)` for inclusive boundaries
- Ensures curfew end events at exact end time are included

**Engine Capacity Calculation**
- Fixed per-runway capacity calculation to use individual separation times
- Resolved issue where all runways assumed same separation
- Corrected formula: `Σ(duration / runway.MinimumSeparation) × rotationMultiplier`

**Test Expectations**
- Adjusted test simulation end times to include final curfew end events
- Fixed leap year test expectations (366 days vs 365)
- Corrected event count assertions for overnight curfews

#### Technical Details

**Architecture Improvements**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Policies generate events, engine calculates capacity
- **Time-Window Calculation**: Discrete windows between state changes
- **Chronological Processing**: Priority queue ensures correct event order
- **State Immutability**: World state only modified via events
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new event types and policies

**Performance Characteristics**
- Event processing: O(n log n) where n = number of events
- Memory usage: O(n) for event queue
- Typical event count: 732 for full year (1 rotation + 731 curfew)
- Simulation time: Sub-second for annual calculations

**Capacity Formula**

For each time window [t₁, t₂]:
```
window_capacity = Σ(duration / runway.separation) × rotation_multiplier

If curfew_active:
    window_capacity = 0

total_capacity = Σ(all windows)
```

**Event Processing Flow**
```
1. Policies generate events → EventQueue
2. Sort events by time (priority queue)
3. For each event:
   a. Calculate capacity [previous_time, event_time]
   b. Apply event (modify world state)
   c. Update previous_time
4. Calculate final window [last_event, end_time]
5. Return total capacity
```

#### Migration Guide

**For Existing Code Using Old API:**

1. **Update Airport Configuration:**
```go
// OLD
airport := Airport{
    MinimumSeparation: 60 * time.Second,
    Runways: []Runway{{...}},
}

// NEW
airport := Airport{
    Runways: []Runway{{
        MinimumSeparation: 60 * time.Second,
        ...
    }},
}
```

2. **Update Policy Usage:**
```go
// OLD - Not supported anymore
type MyPolicy struct{}
func (p *MyPolicy) Apply(ctx, state, logger) error { ... }

// NEW
type MyPolicy struct{}
func (p *MyPolicy) GenerateEvents(ctx, world EventWorld) error {
    world.ScheduleEvent(myEvent)
    return nil
}
```

3. **Update Tests:**
```go
// OLD
state := &mockSimulationState{...}
policy.Apply(ctx, state, logger)
assert(state.operatingHours == expected)

// NEW
world := newMockEventWorld(start, end, runways)
policy.GenerateEvents(ctx, world)
assert(world.CountEventsByType(EventType) == expected)
```

#### Known Limitations

**Current Implementation:**
- Maintenance windows distributed evenly (not optimized)
