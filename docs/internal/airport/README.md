## type Airport

Airport represents a physical airport with all its subcomponents.

```go
type Airport struct {
    Name              string        // The commercial name of the airport
    IATACode          string        // The IATA code of the Airport
    ICAOCode          string        // The ICAO code of the Airport
    City              string        // The city where the airport is located
    Country           string        // The country where the airport is located
    Runways           []Runway      // A list of runways at the Airport
    MinimumSeparation time.Duration // Minimum separation time between movements on the same runway
}
```

<a name="Runway"></a>
## type Runway

Runway represents a physical runway with all operational parameters.

```go
type Runway struct {
    RunwayDesignation string        // Runway designation (e.g., "09L", "27R")
    TrueBearing       float64       // True bearing of the runway in degrees
    LengthMeters      float64       // Length of the runway in meters
    WidthMeters       float64       // Width of the runway in WidthMeters
    SurfaceType       SurfaceType   // Surface type of the runway (e.g., "Asphalt", "Concrete", "Grass")
    ElevationMeters   float64       // Elevation of the runway above sea level in meters
    GradientPercent   float64       // Gradient of the runway in percent
    MinimumSeparation time.Duration // Minimum separation time between incoming flights
}
```

<a name="SurfaceType"></a>
## type SurfaceType

SurfaceType represents the type of surface of the runway.

```go
type SurfaceType int
```

<a name="Asphalt"></a>

```go
const (
    Asphalt SurfaceType = iota
    Concrete
    Grass
    Dirt
)
```
